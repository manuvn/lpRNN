# Code for the paper High performance RNNs with spiking neurons

Each folder contains code for the th different tests conducted in the paper.
We also provide with a reference implementation of the low pass models here.

Python 3.6 is used.
Keras is essential.

1. Adding - For the extended add task.
2. Copying - For the extended copu task
3. PTB - For Penn Tree Bank
4. Spoken Command - lpRNN for Google Spoken command and mapping task.
5. SD_nets - For modeling and testing the spiking simulations for the sigma delta neuron and its network implementations. ALso includes the source code for Spiker and reference implementations.

Enjoy! :)
