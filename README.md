# Code for the paper Low pass RNN and its neuromorphic applications

Each folder contains code for the th different tests conducted in the paper.
We also provide with a reference implementation of the low pass models here.

Enjoy! :)

Python 3.6 is used.
Keras is essential.
Each task has different dependencies that we have attempted to list within the task folders. However, it is likely to be incomplete. Apologies if you have trouble running the code.
